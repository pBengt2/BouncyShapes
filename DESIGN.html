<b>Name:</b> Peter Bengtson<p>

I made an abstract class for shapes, which had child classes Rectangle and Circle. <br>
This allowed for more versitility as other classes did not need to be aware if they were using Rectangles or Circles. <p>

I used doublebuffering and had the timer call a frameRefresh function every 17 ms(1/60th of a second). <br>
This resulted in smoother animation and clearer to understand than multiple previous attempts. <p>

I decided to have the buttons as a small row in order to allow for more space for shapes. <br>
I then treated the bottom of the buttons as the y value limit instead of the very top to remove overlap conflicts. <p>

The organization could have been improved with a better understanding of the concepts and java api in advance. <br>
Specifically, I would have liked to have been able to clean up collision detection to be able to easily add interobject collisions.
