# Bouncy Shapes

This program was created in cs342 at UIC. The assignment was to create shapes on mouse click, and to simulate them falling with fake gravity. I expanded upon this to make the shapes bounce upon hitting the ground.

## How to use

Left click to drop a shape.
Right click to switch between shapes (removes shapes currently on the screen).
-Default shape is a rectangle, the other shape is a circle.
The buttons at the top left change the radius(size) of the circles.
The buttons at the top right change the tesselation(smoothness) of the circles. Enjoy! 

## How to run

Simply compile and run.

## Programming Environment

Java, Notepad++, Windows 7
